# EmployeeManagementAPI
This is api for employee management in .net core
I have 2 repo where one repo contains UI interface of employee management and other one contains API backend in .net core.
Download both the project and change the configuration according to your needs.
Database can be created using code first approach as I have used entity framework core and all the model and entity class is already created.
